About These Icons
------------------

Size: 16 x 16 px
Background: transparent
Format: gif (transparent gif)
Outer border-color: dark brown, coffee shade

These are pixel icons, so there are no jagged edges, 
regardless of the background color used. 

HOWEVER, they were created with white and light-colored 
backgrounds in mind. They have a dark brown, coffee shade 
border that looks best with white and light-colored 
backgrounds.
